# Shipment Tracker
Final project for our group at Le Wagon. The shipment tracker will be used by the NGO Aid Pioneers to send trucks of donations to Ukraine. 

## Target
A German NGO that is sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

## Pain
Shipments can get lost and delayed when truck contents and location are unclear. Also donors can't easily see where their donation ends up.

## Solution
A product that gets truck locations and shipment-info like routes, content and IDs from scanning QR-codes and shows these on a map.
